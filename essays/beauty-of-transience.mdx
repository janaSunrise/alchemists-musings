a big realization: life's temporary. the experiences, bonds, possessions are temporary aswell. but they become an impact for the next
generations. we tend to cling to such things very hard. even despite being such well aware of this fact, we keep on clinging to them.
maybe it's always those thoughts that stick to us, nurturing us with a sense of satisfaction, and happiness. moving on is hard. in
reality, nothing is permanent, and this is the absolute beauty of transience.

there's something captivating about the beauty of transience, a concept that seems paradoxical at first glance. we often associate
beauty with things that are permanent and enduring. awareness makes us realize it's not timeless and sprinkles the missing essence of
vibrancy to it.

there's probably a reason we're asked to be in the moment. everything is temporary, we're forced to enjoy and cherish the moments we
have right now. we're asked to let go of things that are inevitably slipping away from us. we're freed of a huge burden when we
actually do that. we learn and accept the impermanence of life. beauty of transience lies in its impermanence.

here's my fav quote from naruto on that:

> if you remain stuck in the past, and refuse to look into the future, can you really say you're living in the moment?

the japanese concept of wabi-sabi encapsulates this idea, celebrating the imperfections and transience of life as a reminder that
everything is impermanent.

life's evolving. change remains constant and inevitable. transience reminds us that. new experiences form as we break old bonds or let
go of them and new one's form. it's so dumb to say to people they've changed because it's inevitable. our surroundings and experiences
shape the changes we make to make us into who we are and decide our trajectory overall. embracing changes lead to embracing transience.

most importantly, the beauty of transience lies in its ability to teach us gratitude. concepts last forever, experiences don't. in a
world that often seems fixated on the pursuit of eternal youth and immortality, the beauty of transience provides a refreshing
perspective. transience may be fleeting, but its beauty is everlasting.

enjoy while you're at it.
