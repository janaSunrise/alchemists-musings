in the age of fast-paced world, reflection is usually overlooked and dismissed. in reality, it's the opposite. it's often a way to
look back on our experiences, gain perspective and clarity.

reflections in simple terms is a way of using time that's common among people who create things, like writers and programmers.
it's the time when we step back from the constant buzz of notifications and meetings, and take a moment to think deeply about our work,
our decisions, and our lives.

in this time, just like async work is the new thing while meetings can ruin a builder's flow, distractions prevent us from reflecting
to understand ourselves better. we're bombarded with information and stimulation, from social media notifications to endless
notification cycles. we easily strangle ourselves in busy schedule of work with little to no time to actually perceive and understand
what's actually happening. everything happens in blink of an eye.

the essence of reflection is to actually understand our priorities, analyse our shortcomings and applies to every part of our life we'd
imagine. we're in a time where instant gratification is the norm and focus is overrated, this definitely helps us revert that. we manage
to break free from the cycle of mindless consumption and self-gratification.

reflection doesn't need to happen through meditation or journaling. it can be done asynchronously too. **FEEDBACK** is exactly the
thing we require. genuine feedback helps us review and contemplate our shortcomings using valuable insights and help us identify blind
spots in our thinking and behavior.

the essence of reflecting isn't a lot to write on, probably because it's a simple concept. it's just crazy how everyone has lost track
of time and they don't even realise it. everyone's working hard to climb to the top but ironically it's always the people in the top who
actually spend time analysing the most than working hard. they're the ones who have a clear idea of what the essence of reflection is.
