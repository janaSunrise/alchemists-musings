what is this idea of reality we constantly keep on questioning? a question that has been probably around ages with an ever changing
answer varying person to person. a question that has fiddled with philosophers, scientists, and curious minds throughout history.

reality is often perceived as the concrete world we live and socialize in. a fluid and ever-evolving entity. as our understanding and
perception of the world around us expands, so too does the idea of reality. a better way to describe it would be that it's not a fixed
construct but a dynamic tapestry woven by our collective consciousness.

the essence of what actually is reality lies in the interplay between perception and existence. we have a constant behaviour of tending
to rely on our external senses to perceive and inform us of the world around us, reflecting an objective reality. to contradict this
notion, science and philosophy have shown us that our senses are not always reliable and can be easily deceived. this is where we're
shown how easily we're influenced by biases, illusions, and even our own expectations.

reality- it's driven by our insatiable curiosity, our relentless pursuit of knowledge and understanding. with new philosophical
revelation, or personal revelation, our concept of reality takes on new dimensions. we're moving towards challenging and bending
the rules of reality as we move forward in time.

in this age of rapid technological advancement and interconnectedness, our perception of reality is being reshaped like never before.
augmented experiences and artificial intelligence are blurring the lines between what is real and what is fabricated. we find ourselves
navigating a landscape where truth and illusion intertwine, where the boundaries of what we once considered real are being pushed to
their limits.

among this hides the core of what builds reality up. the core of what makes reality real - the human experience. this creates the
fabric of reality. our connections, relationships, and interactions shape our perception of the world and imbue it with meaning.
being human is a superpower of it's own, in a way. we're able to create our own reality, to shape it and define it. there's something
that we have, that animals lack, robots lack - the ability to create meaning. we're able to create meaning out of nothing. the
the beautiful complexities we're able to build, and how we're able to paint a canvas from chaos to order.

in the evolving tapestry of reality, we discover the boundless potential of our own existence and the interconnectedness of all things.

at an individual level, reality is a subjective experience. it's all about how you shape it and learn to parse it. it's about how you
choose to live it. it's about how you choose to define it.
