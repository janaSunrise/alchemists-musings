we're living in the age where instant gratification is the trend. it's what everyone keeps on seeking. we eliminate the joy and process
of doing things. things have been built to be easy and instant providing us the feeling of gratification. for an example, we're so used
to it that we can't even wait couple of seconds for a website to load. is the constant need for instant gratification really doing
us any favors, short-term or long-term?

this is no less of an addiction. once we get lured into it, we forget the meaning we aspire to build and surrender ourselves to be
trapped in a cycle of consumption and emptiness. we keep on seeking it and it's never enough. we're never satisfied. it's a trap that
has no real benefits whatsoever.

the danger of instant gratification is that it robs us of our ability to delay gratification. it even ruins our decision making
workflow and unhealthy behavior. we're stuck in constantly seeking immediate pleasure and avoiding pain. we manage to make impulsive
choices without thinking it over much. we may choose junk food over a healthy meal, procrastinate on important tasks, and prioritize
short-term pleasure over long-term goals.

instant gratification wasn't much big of a problem until the rise of tiktok. then, followed by the growth of other renowned social
media platforms by integrating short form content. ever since we started consuming short form content, it has indirectly been taking a
toll on our mental health. we're so used to consuming short form content that we can't even focus on long form content. our attention
spans have been decreasing and we're in constant pursuit to seek dopamine hits. patience? nonexistent.

here's a video definitely worth the time watching (i promise).

the addiction towards instant gratification leads towards increased stress and anxiety. we go from being sane and being in the moment to
a constant state of tension and anxiety. we forget about the joy of anticipation, the thrill of working towards a goal, and the sense of
accomplishment that comes from achieving something meaningful. this prevent us from truly enjoying the things that matter most in life.
we may miss out on the simple joys of life like spending time with loved ones, enjoying tiny things, or pursuing our passions.

by learning to delay gratification, we can break free from the cycle of consumption and find true fulfillment in our lives. capturing
knowledge of our life's calling and developing a deeper sense of satisfaction and significance in our existence is much beneficial in
the long term. we rediscover the joy of anticipation, the thrill of achievement, and the satisfaction of a life well-lived. i wouldn't
simply reiterate on the common phrase of "enjoying the process than focusing on the destination", should i? lol.
