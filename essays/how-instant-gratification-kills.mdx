we're living in the age where instant gratification is the trend. it's what everyone keeps on seeking. we eliminate the joy and process
of doing things. everything has been built to be easy and instant giving us the feeling of gratification. for an example, we're so used
to it that we can't even wait for a few seconds for a website to load. is this constant need for instant gratification really doing
us any favors, short-term or long-term?

this is no less of an addiction. when we get a taste of it, we're technically stuck in an infinite loop. we keep on seeking it and
it's never enough. we're never satisfied. we're never content. we're never happy. it's a trap that has no real benefits whatsoever.

the problem with instant gratification is how it ruins our decision making workflow and unhealthy behavior. we're stuck in constantly
seeking immediate pleasure and avoiding pain. we manage to make impulsive choices without thinking it over much. we may choose junk
food over a healthy meal, procrastinate on important tasks, and prioritize short-term pleasure over long-term goals.

instant gratification wasn't much big of a problem until the rise of tiktok. then, followed by the growth of other renowned social
media platforms by integrating short form content. ever since we started consuming short form content, it has indirectly been taking a
toll on our mental health. we're so used to consuming short form content that we can't even focus on long form content. our attention
spans have been decreasing exponentially and we're constantly in search of seeking dopamine hits. patience? that doesn't exist anymore.

here's a video definitely worth the time watching (i promise).

the addiction towards instant gratification can also lead towards increased stress and anxiety. we've lost the ability to be patient
and become more impulsive aswell frustrated when we don't get what we want. we go from being sane and being in the moment to
a constant state of tension and anxiety. this prevent us from truly enjoying the things that matter most in life. we may miss out
on the simple joys of life like spending time with loved ones, enjoying tiny things, or pursuing our passions.

we should learn to appreciate delayed gratification and the process of working towards our goals. capturing knowledge of our life's
calling and developing a deeper sense of satisfaction and significance in our existence is much beneficial in the long term. i
wouldn't simply reiterate on the common phrase of "enjoying the process than focusing on the destination", do i? lol.
