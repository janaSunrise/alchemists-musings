title: the paradox of choice

this is a pretty interesting topic. let's do an analogy. you're in front of a massive buffet with every cuisine you can imagine. you're
really hungry, yet you're lost for choices. you choose to prioritize what to eat over hunger. do you go for the indian curries,
the sushi and ramen, or the grilled meat? and then there's the sides, the salads, the desserts. it's overwhelming.

this was just food, but the paradox of choice applies to _every_ area of life. when we're shopping, we're lost for endless choices. we
choose to spend hours reviewing the choices closely and finalizing on something. even then, we're often left with a sense of panic,
overwhelming doubt of whether we made the correct choice and may even regret the choice we make. the same applies to our careers,
relationships, and hobbies. with so many possibilities, it's easy to feel like we're constantly missing out on something better.

here's a quote from the book "The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less" by Barry Schwartz

> the mere presence of options seems to make us less happy with the options we choose.

this is the paradox of choice in action. while having options can be empowering, it can also lead to analysis paralysis. it's not new
that we become unsure of ourselves and feel lost because of this.

to simplify is a solution given way too frequently. even though we tend to find a different solution for the problem after hearing the
same words from everyone out of desperation, that's not the case here. we need to learn simplifing most things in life
(and not the opposite) saying **no**, discard unnecessary options, exercise sound judgement, and resist temptation to choose
what is convenient or easy. learn to eliminate the noise and distractions that come with endless options.

instead of impulsively pursuing any available choice, learn to cultivate selectivity and thoughtfulness in our choices. we should be
deliberate and introspective in determining what we truly desire.

remember that life is short whatever way we perceive it, and we don't have time for bullshit. nothing screams this more than this quote:

> less is often more.
