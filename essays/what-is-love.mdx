title: what is love?

this is something i've been super keen on writing on and addressing. it's morning, and i'm here slacking off of work, and ignoring
breakfast to write this down. i'm writing this down for myself, and for the future me to look back on, and perhaps for you to
read and relate to.

i find myself in a different city currently, and have wandered around the city a bit. not too fancy, but i'm definitely homesick and a bit concerned,
all the average adulting we have to grapple with. instead of going on, writing the same old stuff everyone talks about by generalising love,
i wanted to observe this city and the people. love is everywhere, and perhaps it's the insights that beg exploration, i want to express
here.

i believe i've been in love. i've had crushes, liked people, and have had individuals to care for. especially my girlfriend, who's been
my clandestine ally so long. also, there's a slight apprehension about my parents finding out, but that's another story for another
day.

the true idea of love is based on passing of time without us being aware of it. losing the sense of time while we sit together
and simply share comfortable silence, or get busy with our things with them around, or perhaps in mind. it's *that* element that keeps
you happy without you being consciously aware of its presence. love lies in the shared laughter, the stolen glances, the silent
understanding and the subtle touches. it's the little things that matter, and it's the little things that make it beautiful.

i'm a fellow overthinker, and i've had my fair share of overthinking about love. perhaps, you slowly start understanding that it's
not possible to bring all those thoughts to words because they fall short to capture the essence of how we feel. those are the moments
we just stay silent and appreciate our thoughts and emotions ourselves. there's this idea of butterflies in the stomach. it's not just a
clich√© but the reaction of finding that someone special we hold close to us, cares and loves for us. it's a feeling of being wanted,
and being cared for.

the hues of love on the metro we spectate is quite captivating. some engrossed in a book, finding solace and companionship in the pages.
others giggling among themselves, sharing jokes and snippets of their day, creating a bubble of joy amidst of the chaos. couples
talking and stealing glances, their love evident in the subtle touches, kisses and shared smiles. and then there are those who are just
waiting, lost in their thoughts, perhaps waiting for someone or something to fill the void.

falling in love, and falling for it hard is easy. it's the keeping it forever that's hard. it's something you tend to constantly and handle
it with care. the small gestures, the patience in face of flaws, the mindset of treating it perfect, and finding the beauty in the
imperfections. it's not smooth, but it's worth it. the promise of not leaving each other at any point of time, and the promise of dealing
with the ups and downs, the breakdowns, the tears and the smiles. it's the test of endurance and working hard to sustain it together.

i smile, as i write this. it's not always the grand gestures, or the epic love stories. i believe, everyone has a story to tell,
and the tiny specks of life and love blended together, scattered all over, make it beautiful. i'm just starting out, and i believe i have
something to tell, and something to understand. it's easy to love, but hard to keep it forever. i'm not sure if i'll be able to, but
i'll try my best. i'm grateful for this moment of introspection and the ability to recognize and appreciate the love we get throughout
our lives. here's to a biased, but a beautiful perspective on love.
