title: where does the infinity end?

chasing infinity to the end, we shall. we're in a world of tiktoks, instagram reels and bounded by the 280-character insights, have
we ever stopped to think about the infinity that lies beyond? it's about finding the edge of the universe while we struggle to find where
our instagram feed ends. pretty head wrecking, isn't it?

infinite is treated as a concept, something beyond our comprehension, while existing at the same time. do we call that a paradox, or
probably a contradiction? it can't really be a contradiction, right? because of it's existence, and that it's engraved everywhere
signifying that finding things that's finite is near to impossible. anything that's finite is just a tiny speck being considered relative
to it's surroundings.

let's think about this for a minute. we live in a society that is defined by limits: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a frightening
10% battery life alert. but what about infinity? that's the number family's rebellious adolescent. it defies our normal boundaries.
however, in our technologically advanced society, the notion of infinite is more tangible than ever. consider unlimited scrolling,
infinite content, and infinite possibilities on platforms that claim to be the gateway to the world. yet, when we press refresh, there's
always something new, implying that maybe, just maybe, eternity is a journey rather than a destination.

the only thing we're losing and can't be reverted is time and our attention spans in this modern world. as the infinite oblivion of the
internet continues to grow, we're losing our attention spans to the infinite scroll of the internet. the dichotomy is striking. our
pursuits seem infinite, but our capacities are finite.

infinity, as viewed from a distance, is less about a distinct destination and more about the journey it represents. it's the desire to
test limits and continually wonder, "what's next?" it's humanity's ravenous curiosity wrapped up in an idea, huge and mysterious.
