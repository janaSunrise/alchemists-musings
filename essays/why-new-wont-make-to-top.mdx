title: why everything new won't make to the top

we're thriving in an era of constant innovation and disruption. new tech, products, ideas emerging from every dimension that are
vying for our attention. we're in such a predicament where we're struggling to keep up with the bleeding age tech while risking
falling behind the crowd. but not everything new will make it to the top. in fact, most new things **won't**.

quoting what steve jobs once said:
> It's not enough just to be new; you also have to be better.

there's millions of builders out there building millions of products every day. the market is getting saturated with similar kind of
products as the crowd grows. as the occurrence of similar ideas rises, collisions increase, and the generation of unique ideas decreases.
even if you have a great idea, chances are there are dozens of other people working on *something* similar. although the friction
currently is the lowest to build a business, **thriving** in the market gets hard **exponentially**.

but perhaps luck plays a big factor too. the market is very unpredictable. we never know what might kick off to be worth millions, and
something worth millions just crash. it's a gamble. but the more you play, the more you win. the more you build, the more you learn.
there are so many factors that goes into a successful product launch, but it's impossible to know what works, because something that
doesn't resonate with people now might do later.

to be fair, here's the thing: just because something doesn't make it to the top doesn't mean it's not valuable.
for an example, reading has been around for long yet it holds incredible value. it will not get obsolete anytime soon either becausse
acquiring knowledge isn't the main goal here. we'd still need to be good at writing to have ideas, not just a means to convey them.

let's be realistic here. make the gamble but not with the hopes that you're going to win always, or probably not even half the time.
the only **leverage** you have at any point of time is your **applied knowledge**. use that. sometime in the future, you'll have something that
definitely strikes the attention of people.
