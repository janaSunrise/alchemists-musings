we've all wanted to be millionaires at some point in our lives. this thought prevails among everyone, you're not alone. along with this,
the question of "why?" and "why asap?" pops up aswell.

making money is a common goal everyone works towards, directly or indirectly. indirectly in the sense when they're working on their
skills that would fetch them money later on, or can be monetized. the reasoning behind making money **asap** is simple: it's not just
about having more money in the bank; it's about the freedom and opportunities that money provides.

so, why asap here? because the sooner you start, the sooner you'll get there. for starters it's to maintain a good quality of life and
the basic needs as always. but the better part is that it's a powerful key to unlocking new opportunities and achieving our goals.

getting back to the age old question - "does money buy happiness?" - it necessarily doesn't need to, but it does. we've developed the
need for materialistic things and have attached our emotions to it - it's not a bad thing as long it doesn't take over us. with
money, we're able to satisfy our needs, and probably for others aswell.

the truth is, money is a tool that can help us get where we want to go. having financial stability gives us the freedom to make choices
and take risks. and sometimes, we need to make money fast in order to seize those opportunities.

> Money is a terrible master but an excellent servant.

\- P.T. Barnum

with a side note it's important to not drown completely in the pursuit of money. the quote makes it clear aswell, money is a terrible
master. it's important to not let money control us, but to control money. the he pursuit of money shouldn't consume our lives. it's
important to be proactive and resourceful to make money efficiently. whether that means picking up a side hustle, freelancing, or
finding creative ways to monetize our skills and interests, whatever suits us the best.

financial stability is pretty much very common, yet we talked about why that plays big role. but, growth is a latent factor that
comes along with it. making money quickly requires determination, hard work, and risk-taking. making money can be a catalyst for
personal and professional growth pushing you to become the best version of yourself. it forces you to step outside your comfort
zone and challenge yourself to be better. it teaches you valuable lessons about perseverance, creativity, and innovation, because
you're learning the art of making money and what it takes. the skill that you develop in the process is invaluable, and it can be
leveraged anywhere in life.
